# Simple Java to C bindings via JNA

This post is an introduction to *JNI*, an FFI system for Java.

Most languages offer a way to bind to (use) shared libraries, which
are often written in C (Rust is becoming popular too).  The general
name for such a facility is [*foreign function interface*][ffi] (*FFI*).
FFIs facilitate code reuse, and use of operating system-level
functions that would not otherwise be possible.

There are two significant FFI systems for Java.  The older is [*Java
Native Interface*][jni] (*JNI*)—an official Java standard.  The
[*JSS*][jss] Java binding to the [*NSS*][nss] cryptography and
security library makes heavy use of JNI.  The main drawbacks of JNI
are that it involves writing C, and is boilerplate-heavy.

[nss]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS

[*Java Native Access*][jna] (*JNA*) offers a more lightweight
approach.  You import JNA as a library and define your binding as a
native Java object.  There is only a small amount of boilerplate to
import the JNA packages, open the shared library, and declare Java
method signatures for the functions you want to use.  JNA performs
[automatic conversion][conv] between native Java and C types.

If you are familiar with Python, you might recognise that the JNA
approach is similar to [*cffi*][cffi].  In fact, JNA and cffi use
the same underlying FFI library, [*libffi*][libffi].

## Using JNA in Dogtag

To simplify and speed up [FreeIPA][] startup, I needed to implement
systemd notification support in [Dogtag PKI][].  Dogtag (when so
configured) should call [`sd_notify(3)`][sd_notify] to notify the system service
manager when it has started up and is ready to service requests.

[FreeIPA]: https://www.freeipa.org/
[Dogtag PKI]: https://www.dogtagpki.org/
[sd_notify]: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html

Dogtag already uses JNI in a few places (as does some of its
dependencies, including JSS).  But I was not keen to use JNI, with
all its complexity, for this small use case.  A colleague pointed me
to JNA, and I decided to give it a go.

The resulting code is so small I'll just include it all here, with
commentary.  (I made some changes for clarity; you can review the
actual patch in the [pull request][]).

[pull request]: https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/pull/569/files

```java
package com.netscape.cmscore.systemd;

import com.sun.jna.Library;
import com.sun.jna.Native;

public class SystemdStartupNotifier {
```

Import JNA and begin the class definition.

```java
interface Systemd extends Library {
    public int sd_booted();
    public int sd_notify(int unset_env, String state);
}
```

Declare an interface to the shared library by extending
``sun.jna.Native``.  Method signatures must match the native
function signatures, according to the [type mappings][conv].

```java
Systemd systemd = null;

public void init() {
    systemd = Native.load("systemd", Systemd.class);
}
```

`init()` gets called by initialisation code.  `Native.load()` loads
`libsystemd.so` and initialises the foreign library proxy with
respect to the `Systemd` interface.  The proxy object is assigned to
the instance variable `systemd`.  An alternative approach is to
assign the proxy object to a static variable in the interface
definition ([example][static]).

[static]: https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/5.6.0/www/GettingStarted.md#getting-started-with-jna

```java
boolean notify(String status) {
    if (!systemd.sd_booted()) {
        return true;
    } else {
        int r = systemd.sd_notify(
            0 /* don't unset environment */,
            status);
        if (r < 1) {
            System.err.println("sd_notify failed");
            return false;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

`notify()` makes two foreign calls.  First it calls
[`sd_booted(3)`][sd_booted] to see if the system was booted using
systemd.  If not, we return (successfully).  If the program *is*
running under systemd it calls [`sd_notify(3)`][sd_notify], logging
an error on failure.

That's pretty much all there is to it.  This is much, *much* nicer
than JNI.

## Discussion

The adoption of JNA in Dogtag—which already (and still) uses JNI—was
not without debate.  But JNA is mature, widely available and
supported in Dogtag's target platforms (Fedora and RHEL).  In the
end, it was agreed that JNA is a nice approach.  If JNA becomes
problematic for any reason we can reimplement the binding to use JNI
instead.  The patch was accepted.

As the Dogtag experience demonstrates, where multiple FFI systems
are available it is not necessarily an either/or choice.  JNI and
JNA now happily coexist in the Dogtag database.  It would be nice to
gradually migrate Dogtag away from JNI and use JNA exclusively, but
this is not a priority.

There are more advanced topics that were not covered in this post.
These include callbacks, custom type mapping and dealing with C
``struct`` and ``union`` types.  The [in-tree
documentation][jna-doc] provides guidance on these and other
advanced topics.
